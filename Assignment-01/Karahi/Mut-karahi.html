    <p>Mutton Karahi is a popular South Asian dish known for its rich and aromatic flavors. Tender pieces of mutton are slow-cooked in a karahi, a traditional wok-like pan, with a blend of spices, tomatoes, and green chilies. The dish is characterized by its robust taste, achieved through the unique cooking technique and the use of spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala. Mutton Karahi is often garnished with fresh coriander and ginger, providing a delightful combination of tender meat and bold spices that make it a favorite in Pakistani and Indian cuisine.</p>
