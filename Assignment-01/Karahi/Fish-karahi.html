    <p>Fish karahi is a delectable Pakistani seafood dish that features succulent pieces of fish cooked in a wok-like utensil called a "karahi." The fish is marinated in a blend of aromatic spices, including cumin, coriander, and red chili powder, lending it a rich and flavorful taste. Slow-cooked with tomatoes, green chilies, and ginger-garlic paste, the dish achieves a perfect balance of tanginess and heat. Garnished with fresh coriander, it is often served with naan or rice for a delightful and satisfying meal.</p>
