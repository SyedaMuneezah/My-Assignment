   <p>Chicken karahi is a popular South Asian dish characterized by succulent pieces of chicken cooked in a wok-shaped, deep, and robust utensil known as a "karahi." The dish is renowned for its rich and aromatic tomato-based gravy, infused with a blend of traditional spices like ginger, garlic, and green chilies. The karahi preparation imparts a unique smoky flavor to the tender chicken, creating a delightful harmony of spices and textures. Often garnished with fresh cilantro, this flavorful and visually appealing dish is a favorite in Pakistani and North Indian cuisine.</p>
