    <p>Shashlik, also known as shish kebab, is a traditional Central Asian and Caucasian dish that consists of skewered and grilled meat, usually served with a variety of accompaniments. The meat, often marinated in a flavorful blend of spices, is threaded onto skewers and cooked over an open flame or on a grill, resulting in a deliciously charred and succulent dish. Shashlik can feature different types of meat such as lamb, beef, or chicken, and the marinade can include ingredients like garlic, vinegar, and various herbs. This popular and versatile grilled delicacy is enjoyed across many cultures for its smoky aroma and rich, savory taste.</p>
