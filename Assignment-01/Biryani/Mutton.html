    <p>Mutton biryani is a delectable South Asian rice dish that features succulent pieces of tender mutton (goat meat) infused with aromatic spices. The dish is characterized by fragrant basmati rice layered with marinated mutton, caramelized onions, and a blend of exotic spices such as cumin, cardamom, and cloves. Slow-cooked to perfection, the biryani is sealed with a layer of dough to trap the flavorful steam, ensuring each grain of rice is infused with the rich taste of the meat and spices. Served garnished with fresh cilantro and mint, mutton biryani is a celebration of flavors and textures in every satisfying bite.</p>
