    Fish biryani is a delectable South Asian rice dish that combines fragrant basmati rice with succulent pieces of marinated fish. The rice is infused with a blend of aromatic spices such as cumin, coriander, and garam masala, creating a rich and flavorful base. Tender fish, usually marinated in a spicy masala, is layered between the rice, allowing the flavors to meld during the cooking process. Garnished with fresh coriander and served with raita (yogurt sauce), fish biryani offers a delightful fusion of spices and textures, making it a popular and satisfying seafood variation of the traditional biryani.
